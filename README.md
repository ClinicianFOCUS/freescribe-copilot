- **Automatic Note Generation**: Generate concise SOAP notes using an AI model trained for medical documentation.
- **Customizable Transcription and AI Settings**: Configure transcription server, API keys, and language model preferences.
- **Device Support**: Choose from multiple audio input devices for flexible recording.
- **Real-time Processing**: Option to enable or disable real-time audio processing and note generation based on silence detection.
